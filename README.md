# Using Databases with Julia, R, SAS, and Python

Jenna Landy and Nick Padilla in collaboration with Hunter Glanz and Rebecca Ottesen

## Description

A bookdown was written over the course of a STAT 400 class at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. For each section, we walk through the processes using SAS, Julia, R, and Python. These programming languages are common in statistics and among Cal Poly statistics students.

A shiny application was also created to demonstrate the interaction of RShiny and databases.
