# Machine Setup

The manual takes uses the OCDB driver/ connection string method to connnect to the Stats repository. 
These drivers are proprietary to the SQL service you are using, so they need to be installed for each server type you wish to connect to.
Connection strings refers to the passwords and information needed to connect to the database, as well as the format that that information 
needs to be specified in. Connection strings are also specific to the database you are connecting to.
For this example the driver and connection string can be found at the link below.


Microsoft SQL Server Drivers can be found at:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15


After downloading, the drivers can be installed by running the following commands in a terminal.


## Linux - Ubuntu
```bash
sudo su
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -

#Download appropriate package for the OS version
#Choose only ONE of the following, corresponding to your OS version

#Ubuntu 16.04
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list

#Ubuntu 18.04
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list

#Ubuntu 19.10
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/19.10/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list

exit
sudo apt-get update
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql17
# optional: for bcp and sqlcmd
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install mssql-tools
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# optional: for unixODBC development headers
sudo apt-get install unixodbc-dev
```

## Mac OS
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew update
HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1 ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install msodbcsql17 mssql-tools
```

## Windows
download and open msodbcsql.msi file from:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15#download-for-windows

## Other Connection Options
Once drivers are installed, you can set a dsn (data source name) for the connection to the database using the ODBC/DSN manager for your system.
This is OS-specific and while it will allow a single user to access the database more easily, it must be configured for every user who wishes to connect to the data source. Therefore, to more easily share code and to not have to mess with their behind-the-scenes settings, I use the connection string method from here further.
