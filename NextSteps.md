# Next Steps / Suggestions for Moving Forward

- Continue a discussion about how much to incorporate SQL into this apartment. Options include full lectures, DataCamp practice, short readings, or as little as reading the databases section of Chapter 1.

- Investigate using RedHat.

- Add small case study problems, either as examples or for students to complete on their own. For example:
  - Build a small relational database.
  - Build the bakery relational database and connect to it through the Shiny application associated with this book.
  - Pull complex data from an API, manipulate it or subset it, and write to a database. Compare time difference between pulling from API and manipulating it each time, and pulling from database.
  - Pull time-sensitive data, such as from the Twitter API, and write to a database. Also, write a script to download new data and add it to the database. Test running this script once the API has new data, and make sure it works.
  - Pull data from an API that rate-limits, for example the GitHub API, and write it to a database. Investigate different work-arounds for rate-limiting (e.g. "sleeping" the program until the API will let you back in, creating multiple API keys and switching between them, etc.).
